[00:10.46] Bet you feel like a rock star, don't you now?
[00:13.35] I know you get off every time you get me
[00:16.05] Down like a rock star gon' too far
[00:18.80] You got us all livin' on the seesaw now
[00:38.30] 
[00:21.46] Peter Piper picked a pickled pepper and he went off
[00:24.20] Butcher, baker, candle maker thirsty for the power
[00:26.89] Bouncin' 'round the room with a supersonic blaster
[00:29.56] Givin' up the doom as the clock is tickin' faster
[00:32.18] Kiwi is a cross of a strawberry and a lime
[00:34.87] So detuned that the truth is a tight line
[00:37.33] Givin' titty twisters like you're stuck in 1999
[00:40.12] Ate what you fed me, poot, poot, and it's a gold lime
[01:06.62] 
[00:42.77] Lean back just like that
[00:45.46] Push me down, make me do that dance
[00:47.84] So squeeze that, no more hands
[00:50.66] Bit my lip like a vampire bat
[00:53.11] Now lean back just like that
[00:56.06] Push me down, make me do that dance
[00:58.38] So squeeze that, no more hands
[01:01.36] Bit my lip like a vampire
[01:13.86] 
[01:03.65] Don't you feel like a rock star, don't you now?
[01:06.73] I know you get off every time you get me
[01:09.34] Down like a rock star gon' too far
[01:12.00] You got us all livin' on a seesaw now
[01:15.08] Like a rock star, don't you now?
[01:17.45] I know you get off every time you get me
[01:20.09] Down like a rock star gon' too far
[01:22.73] You got us all livin' on a seesaw now
[01:41.23] 
[01:28.18] Every time you get me down, get me down
[01:33.31] Every time you get me, get me, get me down
[01:54.31] 
[01:46.86] All in my face, Don Quixote, hee-haw
[01:49.35] Spank the monkey, more bananas than Diddy Kong
[01:51.96] Shattered like a melon thrown from the Eiffel Tower
[01:54.62] Such a fuckin' menace, you're a Dennis, you're a true Hobbes
[01:57.45] Hey, man, what was that? Gimme back my ciggie tax
[01:59.93] 90% of a motherfuckin' ten-pack
[02:02.82] Took it to the club and you put it in a piggy bank
[02:05.44] Butterfingers dippin' lobster claws with your fat cats
[02:32.44] 
[02:08.11] Lean back just like that
[02:10.50] Push me down, make me do that dance
[02:13.12] So squeeze that, no more hands
[02:16.02] Bit my lip like a vampire bat
[02:18.44] Now lean back (just like that)
[02:21.39] Push me down, make me do that dance
[02:23.78] So squeeze that, no more hands
[02:26.67] Bit my lip like a vampire bat
[02:41.17] 
[02:29.45] Don't you feel like a rock star, don't you now?
[02:32.00] I know you get off every time you get me
[02:34.74] Down like a rock star (down) gone too far (down)
[02:37.54] You got us all
[02:44.54] 
[02:40.17] (Bet) like a rock star, don't you now?
[02:42.70] I know you get off every time you get me
[02:45.48] Down like a rock star gon' too far
[02:48.00] You got us all livin' on the seesaw now
[02:50.99] Like a rock star, don't you now?
[02:53.46] I know you get off every time you get me
[02:55.94] Down like a rock star gon' too far
[02:58.69] You got us all livin' on a seesaw now
[03:17.19] 
[03:04.09] Every time you get me down (every time you get me down, get me down)
[03:09.63] Every time you get me, get me, get me down
[03:14.90] Every time you get me down (every time you get me down, get me down)
[03:20.16] Every time you get me, get me, get me down
