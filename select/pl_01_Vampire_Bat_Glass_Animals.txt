Bet you feel like a rock star,
don't you now?
I know you get off every
time you get me
Down like a rock star gone
too far
You got us all living
on a seesaw now
Peter Piper picked
a pickled pepper and he
went off
Butcher, baker,
candle maker thirsty for
the power
Bouncing 'round the room
with a supersonic blaster
Eating up the doom as the
clock is ticking faster
A kiwi is a cross
of a strawberry and a lime
So detuned that the truth
is a tight line
Giving titty twisters
like you're stuck in 1999
Ate what you fed me, poot, poot,
it's a gold lime
Lean back just like that
Push me down,
make me do that dance
Oh, squeeze that, no more hands
Bit my lip like a vampire bat
Now lean back just like that
Push me down,
make me do that dance
Oh, squeeze that, no more hands
Bit my lip like a vampire
Bet you feel like a rock star,
don't you now?
I know you get off every
time you get me
Down like a rock star gone
too far
You got us all living
on a seesaw now
Like a rock star, don't you now?
I know you get off every
time you get me
Down like a rock star gone
too far
You got us all living
on a seesaw now
(Every time you get me down,
get me down)
(Every time you get me, get me,
get me down)
All in my face, Don Quixote,
hee-haw
Spank the monkey,
more bananas than Diddy Kong
Shattered like a melon
thrown from the Eiffel Tower
Such a fucking menace,
you're a Dennis,
you're a true Hobbes
Ayy, man,
what was that? Give me back
my city tax
Ninety percent
of a motherfucking ten-pack
Took it to the club and you
put it in a piggy bank
Butter fingers,
dipping lobster claws with
your fat cats
Lean back just like that
Push me down,
make me do that dance
Oh, squeeze that, no more hands
Bit my lip like a vampire bat
Now lean back just like that
Push me down,
make me do that dance
Oh, squeeze that, no more hands
Bit my lip like a vampire bat
(Bet you feel like a rock star,
don't you now?)
(I know you get off every
time you get me)
(Down like a rock star gone
too far)
(You got us all)
Like a rock star, don't you now?
I know you get off every
time you get me
Down like a rock star gone
too far
You got us all living
on a seesaw now
Like a rock star, don't you now?
I know you get off every
time you get me
Down like a rock star gone
too far
You got us all living
on a seesaw now
(Every time you get me down,
every time you get me down)
(Every time you get me, get me,
get me down)
(Every time you get me down,
every time you get me down)
(Every time you get me, get me,
get me down)
