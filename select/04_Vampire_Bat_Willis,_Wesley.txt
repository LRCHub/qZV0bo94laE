Once upon a time
A man was attacked by a vampire bird
He was sucked to death
The vampire bird killed him at last

Vampire bat, vampire bat
Vampire bat, vampire bat
Vampire bat

The lake of fire tore his ass up
He was burning to the crisp
He was cast into the lake
Of burning flame

Vampire bat, vampire bat
Vampire bat, vampire bat
Vampire bat

After the vampire bird sucked blood out of me
He started stabbing me in my ass
Then three more vampire birds stabbed me in my ass too
They sucked the blood out of me, killing me

Vampire bat, vampire bat
Vampire bat, vampire bat
Vampire bat

Rock over London, rock on, Chicago
Folgers, it's good to the last drop
