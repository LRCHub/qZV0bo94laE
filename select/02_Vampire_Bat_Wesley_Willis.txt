Once up on a time a man was attacked by a vampire bird
He was sucked to death
The vampire bird killed him at last
Vampire bat
Vampire bat
Vampire bat
Vampire bat
Vampire bat
The lake of fire tore his ass up
He was burning to the crisp
He was cast into the lake of burning flame
Vampire bat
Vampire bat
Vampire bat
Vampire bat
Vampire bat
After the vampire bird sucked blood out of me, he started stabbing me in my ass
Then three more vampire birds stabbed me in my ass too
They sucked the blood out of me, killing me
Vampire bat
Vampire bat
Vampire bat
Vampire bat
Vampire bat
Folgers, it's good to the last drop
